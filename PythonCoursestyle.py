    Python is a versatile programming language. It's used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more.
    
    In this section, you'll learn:
    - What is Python?
    - History of Python
    - How Python is used in various industries.
    
    Let's dive in!

    - Python is a general-purpose programming language that's used to build software, websites, and more. 
    - It's also used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. 
    - Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use.

    st.markdown("""
    Variables are containers for storing data values. You can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the equals sign (`=`).

    Example:
    ```python
    x = 5
    y = "Hello, World"
    print(x)
    print(y)
    ```

    Variables can store different types of data, including numbers, strings, and more.

def data_types_lesson():

    Python supports various data types, such as:
    - `int` for integers
    - `float` for decimal numbers
    - `str` for strings
    - `bool` for boolean values (True or False)
    
    Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = 3.14
    name = "Python"
    is_active = True
    ```

    Data types are essential because they determine how data is stored and manipulated in your program.

def control_flow_lesson():

    Control flow allows you to control the execution of your code. This includes:
    - `if` statements
    - `for` loops
    - `while` loops

    Example:
    ```python
    x = 10
    if x > 5:
        print("x is greater than 5")
    ```

    Loops allow you to iterate over a sequence of items or repeat code multiple times.

def functions_lesson():
    st.header("Lesson 4: Functions in Python")
    st.markdown("""
    Functions allow you to encapsulate code that can be reused. You define a function using the `def` keyword.

    Example:
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    
    print(greet("John"))

    Functions help organize your code and make it more modular and maintainable.

def oop_lesson():
    st.header("Lesson 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)")
    st.markdown("""
    OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. It allows for concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

    Example:
    ```python
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.name = name
        
        def bark(self):
            return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

    OOP helps in structuring code efficiently and making it more reusable.

def file_handling_lesson():

    File handling allows you to read from and write to files in Python.

    Example of writing to a file:
    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
        file.write("Hello, World!")

    Example of reading from a file:
    ```python
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()

    DSA is a way of organizing data to perform operations efficiently. Common data structures include lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

    Example of using a list:
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    my_list.append(5)
    print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
